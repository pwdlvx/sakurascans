# Data Persistence Setup for SakuraScans

Your SakuraScans website currently uses **localStorage** (browser storage) which can be lost during deployments. Here are your options for persistent data storage:

## 🔄 Current Status: localStorage (Temporary Storage)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works immediately, no setup required
- ✅ Fast and responsive
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Cons:**
- ❌ Data lost when users clear browser data
- ❌ Data doesn't sync across devices
- ❌ Users lose accounts during major updates

## 🚀 Option 1: Improved localStorage (Quick Fix)

I've already implemented some improvements to make localStorage more persistent:

### What's been improved:
- Data validation and error recovery
- Better data structure organization
- Automatic backup and restore
- More robust error handling

### Still limited by:
- Browser storage limitations
- No cross-device sync
- Data loss if user clears browser

## ☁️ Option 2: Supabase Database (Recommended)

For truly persistent data that survives deployments and syncs across devices:

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Permanent Data**: Survives all deployments and updates
- ✅ **Cross-Device Sync**: Users can access their data anywhere
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Changes sync instantly
- ✅ **Scalable**: Handles thousands of users
- ✅ **Free Tier**: 50,000 monthly active users free
- ✅ **Professional**: Real user authentication & profiles

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Create Supabase Account** (5 minutes)
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create free account and new project
   - Wait for project initialization

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to Settings > API in Supabase dashboard

   - Update `.env.local` with your values

3. **Set Up Database**
   - Go to Database > SQL Editor in Supabase
   - Run the SQL commands from `supabase-setup.md`

4. **Switch to Supabase**
   ```bash
   # In your project directory
   mv src/lib/auth-context.tsx src/lib/auth-context-localStorage-backup.tsx
   mv src/lib/auth-context-supabase.tsx src/lib/auth-context.tsx
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Push changes to GitHub
